# Welcome on my Github profile page !

## Who am i ?
### Iâ€™m SpidFightFR.
### Passions?
Iâ€™m interested in Linux, i tend to experiment with it, i love tweaking configs to make it look and feel the way i want. <br>
I like high tech also, i make tiny projects for myself, for fun. <br>
And i also workout from time to time, because our body is a temple (1 Corinthians 6:19), so it's our duty to take care of it.

### Programming Languages?
Iâ€™m currently learning C++, java and C.

### Favorite Distro ? Why ?
ðŸ‘Œ VoidLinux FTW <3
- It's just so convenient, the community is small but very active.
- The tools given to you are amazing (xtools)
- Runit is way faster than systemd for my usage, and it's simpler to use.
- It's not based on anything it's just BASED.

### What do you do in life ?
I'm an IT student and an apprentice as an IT technician. I try to be active but yeah, life is pretty busy. <br>
I also contribute to void when i can, updating packages i like and use... <br>
I also took the lead on the <a href="https://github.com/flathub/io.github.spacingbat3.webcord"> Webcord Flatpak package </a> since it was orphaned.

### What's up with that skull ? <img src="./src/img/Skull.svg" width="30" height="30"/>
Looks familiar ? <br>
Then you might have been a fan of street racing games in the past.
This was an abandonned logo from an in-game character.
Unable to find it anywhere on the net, i managed to extract it, and modify it to adapt it to today's stadards.

It is now an integral part of my visual entity, i consider it my own Logo. (sources in the repo)

### How can i get in touch with you ?
I avoid sharing my email by default. <br>
The most recommanded way would be <a href= "https://getsession.org/">Session</a>, as it's a Signal fork that doesn't rely on personnal info to make an account. <br>
I like not doxxing myself ! <br>
So here's my session ID if you wanna chit-chat: <br>
